 DSA 210 Project-Sleep Data vs Weather Data 

 
 Project Overview
 
I will keep track of my sleep after Ramadan for a month. I will monitor how various kinds of weather influence my sleep. I will record things such as temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, precipitation, and air quality, in addition to how long I sleep and the quality of my sleep. I am curious about what kinds of weather conditions influence my sleep the most. I will use graphs and statistics to determine patterns. The concept is simple: collect night and weather information, seek correlations, and experiment with varying conditions to determine what affects the quality of sleep. In some weekends and holidays, I will be sleeping in different places which will be different environment to get data it will help me to compare.


Objectives

Discover sleep influencers.
Observe how the weather (temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, precipitation, and air quality) influences sleep metrics (duration of sleep, quality of sleep, and disruptions).
Find Key Points
Discover the primary weather conditions that influence sleep and examine how they affect sleeping patterns.
Use Data Science Skills
I would apply what I learned in my DSA 210 course in my real-life situations. This would make me more familiar with collecting, analysing, and visualizing data.


Motivation

Personal Development
The quality of our sleeps influences the way we think, feel, and have energy. Being informed about how weather and air quality influence our sleeps can help us make our lives better.
Scientific Method
Instead of speculation, this project will examine in detail how the environment influences sleep. That way, we can make more informed decisions.
Real-World Application
It is an opportunity to apply what we learned in class to actual work.
Long-term Consequences
The findings will assist me in sleeping better. They shall also demonstrate how information analysis assists with other areas in life, such as exercising and accomplishing things.

Dataset


The records for this piece of work shall be for three consecutive months. These is what I shall monitor:
Sleep Data

Date: When this record was made

Sleep Duration: Total sleeping time (hours)

Sleep Quality: REM, Deep and Light sleep

Night Wakes: I wake up repeatedly throughout the night.

Weather and Air Quality Facts

Temperature: Average daily temperature (°C)

Humidity: Average daily (%)

Air Pressure: Air pressure (hectopascals)

Precipitation: Amount of rain or snow (mm)

Air Quality Index (AQI): A standardized measure of air pollution levels
PM2.5 and PM10 Concentrations: The level of minute airborne particles (µg/m³) that can impair breathing and the quality of sleep.
I shall obtain weather and air quality information from public Accuweather. I shall obtain the sleep information from a sleep tracking app or smartwatch it myself. I shall flag any suspicious information from illness, travel, or major changes in routine for further checking.

Tools and technology.
I shall utilize these tools to gather, verify, and exchange information:
Python: For data cleaning and statistical analysis
Accuweather: To keep track on weather conditions.
Smart watch or sleeping app: For sleeping data.


Analysis Plan


1.Obtaining information
Replace missing values, align timestamps, and standardize units.

2.Visualizing
Use various graphs to examine the relationship between weather, air quality, and sleep patterns. Examples include:
Scatter plot: Sleep duration vs. temperature.
Heatmap: Correlations among all weather, air quality, and sleep variables.
Time series plot: How sleep quality changes over time.

3.Hypothesis Testing
Test concepts like:
H₀: Weather and air quality have no impact on people's sleep.
Hₐ: Sleep quality is significantly impacted by one or more environmental factors.
Conduct regression analysis to identify the strongest predictors of sleep variation.


4.Observing trends.
Examine long-term trends to determine how sleep is impacted by changes in the weather and air pollution. 


Example Analysis
A good concept would be to graph temperature and sleep quality to determine whether there is an ideal range for improved sleep. If there is an obvious trend, it would indicate that temperature matters. One other example compares high-humidity nights with low-humidity nights to determine whether humidity levels influence sleep issues. I will utilize air quality data to determine whether greater PM2.5 is associated with poorer sleep. For instance, if sleep issues increase on days with increased air pollution, this could indicate an association between air quality and the quality of sleep. Similarly, I’ll assess how air pressure changes correlate with sleep quality, exploring whether fluctuations in atmospheric conditions affect sleep duration. 


Conclusion 


When this is complete, I want to be able to answer these questions: 
The major weather and air quality factors that influence sleep most include: 
Will knowing the environmental reasons assist in enhancing sleep habits? 
How can we apply these principles to improve sleep habits? 
 Whether we are talking about accomplishing tasks, exercising, or sleeping, employing data is extremely crucial for long-term success.
